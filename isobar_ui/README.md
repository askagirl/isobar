# Isobar UI

This folder houses Isobar's user interface, which is implemented in JavaScript and designed to run in a web environment. It is depended upon by [`isobar_electron`](../isobar_electron), which presents Isobar as a desktop application, and [`isobar_browser`](../isobar_browser), which presents Isobar in the browser.
