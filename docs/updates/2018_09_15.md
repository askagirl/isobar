# Update for September 15, 2018

Most of my work the past couple of weeks has been inside my head. After finally getting our file system representation to converge, our thoughts turned to how we could package all of this work up in a way that makes it useful outside of randomized unit tests. Of particular concern has been how we can interoperate with Git and implement a server-side experience that could eventually bring real-time collaboration ot GitHub.com. After 24 hours of nearly uninterrupted thinking and writing in my journal Tuesday night, I am converging on an updated approach to bring fully-distributed real-time collaboration to repositories.

## Embracing Git

Our previous vision for Nano was to store the full operational history for the repository in a global database, so that each file's full history would be available in a single structure dating back to its creation. This would essentially duplicate the role of Git as a content tracker for the repository, but with a much more fine-grained resolution. It may eventually make sense to build a global operation index to enable advanced features an analysis, but I don't think it makes sense to conceive of such an index as an independent version control system. For async collaboration, CRDTs probably won't offer enough advantages to induce people to switch away from Git. Even if we managed to build such a system, it would always need to interoperate with Git. So we may as well embrace that reality and build on top of Git. We can then focus on the area where CRDTs have their greatest strength: real-time collaboration and recording the fine-grained eidts that occur *between* Git commits.

Augmenting Git is definitely something I've considered in the past, but it's finally becoming clearer how we can achieve it. We will start by packaging the previous months' work into a library that is similar to `teletype-crdt`. With Teletype, you work with individual buffers. Each local edit returns one or more operations to apply on remote replicas, and applying remote operations returns a diff that describes the impact of those operations on the local replica. Nano will expand the scope of this abstraction from individual buffers to the entire repository tree, but instead of operating on a full replica of the tree as we were imagining previously, you will instead work with a replicated *patch* that represents only the outstanding changes since the last commit.

By making the CRDT representatin sparse and learning on Git to synchronize the bulk of the working tree, we recuce the memory footprint of the CRDT to the point where it can reasonably by kept resident in memory. This also bounds the bandwidth required to replicate the full structure, which obviates the need for complex partial data fetching schemes that we were considering previously. This is turn greatly simplifes backend infrastructure. Because a sparse representation should always be small enough to fully reconstruct from the raw operations on the client, server side infrastructure shouldn't need to process operations in any way other than simply storing them based on the identifier of the patch to which they apply.

## The challenge of undo

One big obstacle to making this patch-based represenation work is undo. In `teletype-crdt`, we implement undo by associating every operation with a counter. If an operation's undo counter is odd we consider the operation to be undone and therefore invisible. If two users undo or redo the same operation concurrently, they'll both assign its undo count to the same number, which preserves both users' intentions of undoing the operation and avoids their actions doubling up or cancelling each other out, which could occur in some other schemes. However, implementing undo in this way comes with a cost, which could occur in some other schemes. However, implementing undo in this way comes with a cost, which is that in order for me to undo an operation that is present in my local history, I need to rely on that operation being present in the history of all my collaborators. This approach to undo combines poorly with resetting to an empty CRDT on each commit, because it forces everyone to clear their undo stack after committing since there won't be any way to refer to prior operations in order to update their undo counters.

This felt like a show-stopper to me until I had a conversation with [@jeffrafter](https://github.com/jeffrafter) about his team's experience using `teletype-crdt` in [Tiny](https://tttiny.com). I don't have a perfect understanding of the details of their approach, but they essentially bypass Teletype's built-in undo system and maintain their own history on each client independently of the CRDT. When a user performs an undo, they simply apply its to the current CRDT and broadcast it as a new operation When I asked about some of the more diabolical concurrency scenarios that the counterscounters were designed to eliminate, Jeff simply replied that it's working for them in practice.

Inspired by their experience, I have a hunch that we can implement undo similarly in our library. For each buffer, we can maintain two CRDTs. One will serve as a local non-linear history allows us to understand the effects of undoing operations that aren't the most recent change to the buffer. We'll perform undos against this local history first, then apply their affects to a CRDT that starts at the most recent commit. This will generate remote operations we know can be cleanly applied by all participants. The local history can be retained across several commits and even be stored locally. By fetching operations from previous commits, we could even construct such a history for clients that are new to the collaboration.

## Stable file references

We also need to be able to reference files and directories unambiguosuly. With the previous representation, this was easy because each file was assigned a unique id at the moment it was inserted into the history. With a sparse representation, however, it will be a bit trickier, and I haven't fully figured it out yet. Ultimately, each file is uniquely identified by its path in the base commit. It seems like we can use this as a sahed source of truth, then allow each replica to associate these paths with unique aliases so they can be efficiently referenced in subsequent operations. On a tactical level, this is really the first problem we need to solve before proceeding with this shift in approach.

## The big picture

By being agnostic to plumbing and building a library that operates purely in terms of operations and data, this software should be useful in a broader array of applications. We plan to distribute a WebAssembly version to enable collaboration in browser-based environments, along with a native executable that can talk to editors and synchronize our CRDT with an underlying file system like we originally envisioned. The operations can serve as a kind of common real-time collaboration protocol. As long as an application can send and receive opreations and feed them into this library, it should be capable of real-time collaboration with other applications.
