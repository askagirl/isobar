## Shared workspaces

We spent the entire week focused on layout down the foundations that will enable shared remote workspaces. You'll be able to start a headless Isobar instance on a remote machine, then have multiple developers connect and co-inhabit that workspace from their desktop.

The fact that our buffers are CRDTs makes concurrent buffer editing relatively straightforward to implement, but we still need a solution for synchronizing state between peers and performing requests and response. After experimenting a bit with Cap'N Proto RPC and feeling a bit overwhelmed by the generated code, we decided to explore what a custom solution might look like.

We're not quite done with the implementation, but after a lot of thinking and a bit of wheel-spinning, we have a reasonably solid design for a capabilities-based RPC system that will be a good fit for our use case. I've written up [a much deeper description](https://github.com/siberianmh/isobar/blob/shared-workspaces/docs/architecture/002_shared_workspaces.md) that will become part of Isobar's permanent documentation. Here's a *huge* diagram to get you interested:

## The weak ahead

We hope to finish an initial take on the RPC system next week, then start using it to build out a basic demo of shared workspaces. Our goal is to make it possible to find and open paths on the client and support concurrent editing by multiple clients.
